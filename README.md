# quizzie
A quiz written in Python and Tkinter





# Installation
For the **latest release**, go to the **Releases** page and find the top one. Then click Assets (under the release notes) and click **Source code (zip)** or **Source code (tar.gz)** depending on your preference. Unzip the files and open a terminal. `cd` into the folder containing the files and type `python3 quizzie`. There -- it's running. If you'd like to just run `quizzie` in the terminal (linux only), type `sudo cp quizzie /usr/bin/quizzie` and enter your password. 

For the **latest stable release**, go to the **Releases** page and find the one labeled on the left "Latest release". Scroll down a bit under the notes and hit **Assets**. Click the appropiate source code option (zip or tar.gz) If you're on Linux I recommend tar.gz, if you're on Mac or Windows I suggest zip. Extract the files and `cd` into the proper directory in a terminal. Type `python3 quizzie.py` in -- and you're in!  
If you'd like to just be able to run `quizzie` in the terminal (Linux only) type `sudo cp quizzie /usr/bin/quizzie` and enter your password.

For the **untested, raw release** DO NOT go to the releases page. Instead, click **Clone or download** and then clone it using git or download a ZIP. If you are a novice I suggest a zip file, otherwise you can use git. Either one works. Extract the files, `cd` into the correct directory, and type `python3 quizzie.py`. If you want to (linux only) just be able to run `quizzie` in the terminal just type `sudo cp quizzie /usr/bin/quizzie` and type your password. 

Done.
